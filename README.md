# Stress testing banks

The project aims to develop predictive models for key financial metrics of banks with the primary objective to leverage macroeconomic indicators to identify banks vulnerable to economic shocks. The motivation was to create a model capable of rapid stress testing for banks, using publicly available data. Timely identification of banks at risk carries the potential to mitigate financial crises by breaking the chain of contagion from one struggling bank to another.
